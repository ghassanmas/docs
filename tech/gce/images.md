# Container Images

Images are built from Github repositories using Github actions and stored in Github container registry.

You can find all of the Github images [here](https://github.com/orgs/wbstack/packages).

**History**

WBStack used to build and deploy images from the Google container registry.

In December 2020 this was stopped and images are now built and stored on Github.

Some images still remain in the wbstack registry (mediawiki 1.34 is still deployed from there).
Once that image is no longer used the registry will be emptied and this documentation removed.
